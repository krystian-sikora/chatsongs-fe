# Chatsongs

In today's digital communication landscape, text messaging applications play a vital role in connecting people, allowing real-time exchange of thoughts, information, and emotions. This project, called Chatsongs, goes beyond traditional messaging by enabling users to not only chat but also enjoy synchronized music playback together, enhancing the social experience.

### Why Chatsongs?

The idea behind Chatsongs combines my passion for music and programming. I wanted to create a platform that enables users to share music in real-time within their chats. At the time of development, no text communication app offered integrated synchronized music playback, which motivated me to choose this as my bachelor's thesis project.
